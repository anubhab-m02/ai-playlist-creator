## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend & Database**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore Database)
* **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API (via `gemini-2.0-flash` model)
* **Icons**: Lucide React

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
* npm or yarn
* A Firebase project set up with Authentication (Email/Password and Google providers enabled) and Firestore.
* A Google Gemini API Key.

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable, otherwise ensure you have all project files):**
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/anubhab-m02/ai-playlist-creator>
    cd mixtape-maestro 
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Firebase Configuration:**
    * Locate the Firebase configuration in `src/firebase.jsx`.
    * Replace the placeholder `firebaseConfig` object with your actual Firebase project's configuration:
        ```javascript
        const firebaseConfig = {
          apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
          authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
          projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
          storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
          messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
          appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
          measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID" // Optional
        };
        ```
    * **Important**: Ensure your Firestore security rules are set up appropriately. For development, you might start with rules that allow reads/writes if authenticated, but for production, you'll need more granular rules. A basic example for development:
        ```
        rules_version = '2';
        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {
            // Allow users to read and write their own data under artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}
            match /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/{document=**} {
              allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
            }
            // Public data (if any planned for future)
            // match /artifacts/{appId}/public/{document=**} {
            //   allow read: if true;
            //   allow write: if request.auth != null; // Example: only auth users can write public
            // }
          }
        }
        ```
        The application currently uses paths like `artifacts/mixtape-maestro-v2/users/{currentUser.uid}/playlists`.

4.  **Gemini API Key Configuration:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the root of your project.
    * Add your Gemini API key to this file:
        ```env
        VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
        ```
    * The application accesses this key using `import.meta.env.VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`.

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    The application should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:5173`.
